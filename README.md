# ML-models-for-Time-Series
In this project we work on Apple Stock data from 2006 to 2018. 
We first do an exploratory data analysis and data visualisation for this time series, including the analysis of trends, cycles (lag features), and seasonality,  
and finally build ML models (Regression models) to predict the Closing Price and Volume of Apple Stock over time.
